# Easy / Anyone ##
## General ##
Feel free to do any or all of them. Any help is welcome. Your own protection first.

## Register / Testing ##
Whonix really requires some people willing to spend some time on testing new Whonix features, bug fixes and such.

I am afraid to say, that anonymous contribution is very difficult. As in January 2012 there is **no one** registered user frequently active in the User Help Forum or on the Developer Mailing List:
https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/mailman/

Pseudonyms help to build reputation and trust over time.

If you can, please create an (anonymous) [E-Mail] account, sign up for the Developer Mailing List and briefly say hello. Don't worry, yet there is almost no traffic on that list. (After on that list is too much activity, a separate Testing Mailing List and/or User Mailing List will be created.)

## Spread ##
Post a news on your website or blog post.

## Follow me ##
Follow [Whonix on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Whonix).

## Feedback ##
Send feedback about Whonix to Whonix developers.

## Tweet ##
Tweet about Whonix. Mention @Whonix and #Whonix. 

## Donate ##
![](http://whonix.sourceforge.net/screenshots/BC_Rnd_64px.png)

Only very few people have donated to Whonix. As in January 2012, only 4 people have donated to Whonix. Many thanks to them! Also many thanks to everyone else who [contributed](https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Contribute/) in other ways!

The total amount of donations is ~1.6 BTC which equals ~13,70 USD, even though, the plea for donations is well visible on every Whonix wiki page and additionally in whonixcheck.

From [2012-10-08 to 2013-01-07](https://sourceforge.net/projects/whonix/files/whonix-0.4.5/Whonix-Gateway.ova/stats/timeline?dates=2012-10-08+to+2013-01-07) 11,921 people have downloaded Whonix-Gateway 0.4.5.

Please donate BitCoin to Whonix developer adrelanos. BitCoin address:

    1JgzCCSox56Sh4NnQJqRiwoxKi8oVSZBEd

If you appreciate adrelanos's work on Whonix, want to say thanks and support further maintenance and development, please donate. It will keep adrelanos motivated. It is no secret, that the money could be spend on amusements as a tiny compensation for the countless hours of research and development.

Adrelanos would like to buy better and more hardware for testing. This would speed up development and improve quality assurance. It could be also used to host a better, multilingual website.

If you want to pay for getting a new feature, this may be possible as well, please get in [Contact] to talk about the details.

The transaction history for Bitcoin is is [visible](https://blockexplorer.com/) to anyone. [Whonix donation Bitcoin address](https://blockexplorer.com/address/1JgzCCSox56Sh4NnQJqRiwoxKi8oVSZBEd) is no exception.

Why am I writing this? Earning money was never the main goal for starting, developing, maintaining and keeping on improving this project. If earning money would have been the goal, the time would have been better spend on other work. Maybe since the the donation button is so well visible and Whonix is in the news most people assume, that there will be already enough donations? Not the case, in the link above you can check how much was donated.

The [Money] page contains information about anonymous money and Bitcoin.

# Forum Moderator #
Please apply as a Forum Moderator. You can help by approving posts by real people and stopping automatic spam bots. And perhaps answer a question if you know the answer, or just leave the question unanswered until adrelanos or someone else answers.

If you want, you get notified about new posts by e-mail. If you could check and moderate the forums a few times every day in your spare time, that would really help.

# Screenshots #
Make awesome Whonix [Screenshots]. <font size="-3">Donate them to Whonix or release them into [public domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)</font>.

# Videos #
We need more Whonix [Videos](http://whonix.sourceforge.net/videos.html). Maybe in your language? No matter if demonstration videos, promotional videos, conceptual videos or tutorials. <font size="-3">Donate them to Whonix or release them into [public domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).</font>

# Social Media / Marketing #
I am not very experienced in maintaining social media representations. Even though they work against privacy goals by collecting a lot data, I believe they are important for marketing and communication nowadays.

If you are willing to help or to maintain Whonix's Twitter account, Facebook page, Google+, YouTube or identic.ca account, please get in contact.

# Release Manager #
If you have no problem having your real name connected to the Whonix project and Tor, please continue reading.

Building Whonix from source is very easy and you get assistance. Building the images takes a long time, if you must do it inside a virtual machine to stay anonymous. Also uploading it over Tor takes very long. Maybe this two points do not apply to you.

Creating the virtual machine images and uploading them would be a big help. This would help establishing beta images, stable images, release candidates and so on.

It would be useful if you already have a reputation. Such as from another (software) project.

# Spokesperson #
Whonix developer adrelanos currently prefers to stay anonymous for reasons listed on the [Trust] page.

Truly anonymous development prevents various things:

* Buying cheap and reliable servers. (Virtual Private Server For a better, multilingual website.)
* Buying a cheap domain.
* More trustworthy binary builds.
* Videos with human speech.
* Voice, video or real interviews.
* Attending conferences.

If you have no problem having your real name connected to the Whonix project and Tor, please apply.

# Lawyer #
Either answering some small questions or filling one piece of paperwork would be immensely helpful.

# Webmaster #
Whonix needs a webmaster. Whonix developer adrelanos can not administrate a webserver and create a full website alone. A website which could be translated to other languages by contributors would be awesome.

# Development #
![Looking for developers!](http://whonix.sourceforge.net/screenshots/Whonix-ad.png)

Whonix is as [easy](https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/FAQ/#how-difficult-is-it-to-develop-whonix) as shell scripting (bash). We need developers! Join Whonix Development Mailing List!

# KDE Desktop Developer #
If you know KDE desktop scripting, for example how to change Desktop view to folder view using a script and would volunteer to answer such questions that would be immensely helpful.

# Audit #
Audit Whonix's security.

A good place is starting with the source code and running

    grep -r "REVIEW" *

for places were I could need more input. Also reviewing the whole source code of course or just the major configuration files would be fine. Or review the design, see [Security] to get started.
