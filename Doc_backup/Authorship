# DISCLAIMER #
## General ##
__**DISCLAIMER:**__ The authors accept NO responsibility for any leaks, faults, detection, incarceration, torture, etc; as  a result of your use of Whonix.  NO WARRANTY expressed or implied.

We have done our best to create this project, but we are not programmers, network experts, tor expert, lawyer, etc; Just a Tor user who have done extensive research on Google. Be careful, use your brain, trust no one but yourself.

## Whonix VPN disclaimer ##
You only have to read this chapter, when you are going to combine Whonix with a VPN.

Whonix is in no way affiliated with any VPN provider. The mentioned VPN provider have been chosen, we simply found them, it was easy to register, no personal information were required and because it was free. Whonix developers do not review or rate VPN providers, that is beyond the Whonix project. You are welcome to post instructions for other free VPN services, which will be threaded equally. In no way any provider is labeled as a good/bad choice.

Depending on what they were used for, they also fulfilled certain criteria, which are mentioned in the specific article. For example: TCP connection supported; not blocking UDP ports; OpenVPN supported, many other free providers offered only access through proprietary, closed source and/or windows-only clients.

Most websites recommend for choosing a good VPN: 
1. Do not use free VPNs, as they observe you, log everything and sell you. 
2. Leave no money trail, pay anonymously. (Bitcoin etc.) 
3. Research their reputation, background, history, location. 
4. Check their privacy policy and terms of service. 
5. They shouldn't ask for any identifying information. (name, postal address, e-mail etc.) 
6. The providers homepage is reachable over http**s** with a valid SSL certificate. 
7. You can use GPG to mail them. 

Use at your own risk.

## Similar Projects ##
Here is a list of projects with similar goals to Whonix. The list is here for reference. Those projects may have interesting thoughts, mistakes, security enhancements, features and so on. The useful stuff can be potentially ported to Whonix. Some projects inspired the development of Whonix (missing features, implementation reference etc.).

 * [A few reasons listed in this link not to use some of those projects applies here as well.](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/JanusVM)
 * [Torouter](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/Torouter); alpha
 * [Tor and the DreamPlug](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorDreamPlug); similar networking/firewall
 * [Tor and OpenWRT](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/OpenWRT); similar networking/firewall
 * [Transparent Proxy](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxy); it offers: 1. Transparently anonymizing traffic for a specific user; 2. Local Redirection Through Tor; 3. Anonymizing Middlebox; 4. Local Redirection and Anonymizing Middlebox; closest one to Whonix is Anonymizing Middlebox; Whonix is an Isolating Proxy
 * [Transocksifying Tor](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransocksifyingTor); now outdated; back when Tor didn't natively support TransPort; uses a different firewall with DNAT
 * [PELD](https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/); specification and implementation (in the form of Tails
 * [A Tor Virtual Machine Design and Implementation](https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torvm/trunk/doc/design.html); design document
 * [JanusVM](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/JanusVM); insecure
 * [TorVM](http://www.janusvm.com/tor_vm/); from the same authors like JanusVM; [other link](https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torvm/); insecure
 * [TorVPN](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorVPN); the abandoned predecessor of TorBOX (now Whonix); not finished
 * [another TorVM](http://tor.hermetix.org/torvm/index.html.en); from unknown authors; site wants to look similar to official Tor site; fishy
 * [Easy and secure anonymous internet usage](http://ra.fnord.at/2011/05/easy-and-secure-anonymous-internet-usage) by ra; anonymous author; [https://github.com/ra--/Tor-gateway/wiki now with source code]
 * [Tails](http://tails.boum.org); Live CD/USB distribution preconfigured to use Tor safely.; listed on https://www.torproject.org; with [Tor enforcement](http://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/Tor_enforcement/)
 * old instructions from [board.gulli.com](http://board.gulli.com/thread/993224-tutorial-alle-tcp-ip-verbindung-eines-vmware-guests-automatisch-ueber-tor-leiten); in German language; more complicated; back when Tor didn't natively support TransPort
 * [Tor relay in virtualized OpenBSD with KVM](http://blog.minibofh.org/2011/01/03/tor-relay-in-virtualized-openbsd-with-kvm); no review yet
 * [VM basierende Anonymisierung](http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/VM_basierende_Anonymisierung); German; not very sophisticated

 * ["My Hidden Blog" - Hosting Tutorial](http://lotjbov3gzzf23hc.onion/hostingtutorial/); based on [Tor Hidden Service Server in a box -- Tor Hidden Service VM](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/aczeskis/random/tor-hidden-service-vm.html); no review
 * [Liberté Linux](http://www.dee.su/); Live CD based on hardened Gentoo; No isolation between client applications and Tor, infrequent security releases.
 * [Qubes](http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2011/09/playing-with-qubes-networking-for-fun.html); focuses on security through isolation based on virtualization. This blog post provides some hints how to integrate Tor but the actual implementation is left to the user.
 * [Hidden Service Setup Guide for Newbies (Version .2)](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2009-September/019541.html); howto; you don't have to download the pdf, you find the guide on google and in google cache (google the pdf link)
 * [VMWare Through Tor](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/VMWareThroughTor) Getting Tor to proxy connections from inside the VMWare Browser Appliance.
