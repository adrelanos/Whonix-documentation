# Updating Tor #
Tor was installed on Whonix according to [official instructions for Ubuntu](https://www.torproject.org/docs/debian#ubuntu). You can update Tor (and the rest of the system) using *apt-get update* and *apt-get dist-upgrade*.

If you run in the following error message when running *apt-get update* on the Gateway...

    W: GPG error: http://deb.torproject.org precise Inrelease: The following signature were invalid: Keyexpired 1346668560

...or into the following error message on the Gateway when running *apt-get dist-upgrade*:

    Warning: The following packages cannot be authenticated!
    deb.torproject.org-keyring tor
    Install these packages without varification?

...please use the workaround below. Please do not install without verification for your own safety!

Temporary fix. Run these two commands. (Check if they are still current and genuine in official instructions for Ubuntu.)

    gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv 886DDD89

    gpg --export A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89 | sudo apt-key add -

(If they fail for the first time, perhaps because you are on a slow network or slow Tor circuit, run them a few times until the succeed.)

,, Technical problem: The latest Whonix release is a few days ago and in meanwhile there is a new deb.torproject.org-keyring got renewed while the old torproject deb keys expired. Fixing the problem requires a new Whonix release. It will be fixed in 0.3.0.
