# History of Whonix #

Originally called TorBOX, called aos (which stud for anonymous operating system) in meanwhile and finally renamed to Whonix.

TorBOX didn't start as a software project. Originally it was only a wiki site. The goal was to simplify the instructions how to use Tor as a [Transparent Proxy](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxy). **Adrelanos** was amazed by the idea, to have a (virtual) machine where all traffic is routed through Tor and where IP or DNS leaks are impossible with the additional benefit, that there are no proxy settings for any applications necessary anymore. Check the [first version of the torproject.org TorBOX wiki site](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBOX?version=1) how simple it looked like, that was on 2012-01-11.

Quickly other contributors improved the article. You can check that using [torproject.org's wiki history feature](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBOX?action=history). The TorBOX wiki site grew steady in size, information and complexity. Given the complexity of the required steps, it was necessary to provide leak tests, which was done by **smarm**. **Anonymous** created a shell script to do the many steps in an automated way. **Anonymous** created the first downloadable TorBOX images as well. In the past we had separate articles for manual creation of TorBOX, building using the shell scripts and using the downloads. It became to much overhead to maintain the comprehensive manual instructions to build TorBOX while updating the shell scripts as well. The TorBOX developers agreed to drop the manual creation in favor of the shell scripts. Still, nothing got lost doing this transition. The full documentation, an explanation and justification, why each and any step is done was migrated into the shell scripts. Since all shell scripts were written in bash, anyone able to use the command line was still be able to read the bash script and to do the steps manually.

The shell scripts grew steady because more and more knowledge has been researched, more and more things had to be done to make TorBOX even safer or to add even more functionality. After the release of TorBOX 0.1.3 there was no one willing to create new images, because the process of creation was tiresome. Installing the operating system manually, putting the scripts into the virtual machines and running them for every improvement seemed boring and time consuming. The TorBOX developers agreed to make the build process fully automated, that's not done yet, but almost (help welcome). It became also clear, that TorBOX may no longer consist of only two shell scripts, many more files have to be created. Rather it became clear, that a wiki is no longer suited for lots of development related discussion and source code commits. Also a dedicated TorBOX website became required.

# Whonix versions #
## Source for downloaded image ##
The scripts used to build a certain downloaded version of a TorBOX-Gateway or TorBOX-Workstation image can be **also** found in the VM at /usr/share/doc/torbox (in TorBox 0.2 at /usr/local/bin/tor-*) and through the wiki history.

## TorBOX 0.1.3 (old, outdated, released) ##
TorBOX 0.1.3, which was **released** as build from source and download version.

[BuildDocumentation_0.1.3](https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/BuildDocumentation_0.1.3)
[Source Code 0.1.3](https://github.com/adrelanos/Whonix/zipball/0.1.3) (Available as signed git tag. Signed by adrelanos.)

It no longer builds, due to breaking changes from Tor 0.2.2 to Tor 0.2.3.

## TorBOX 0.2.0-debootstrap (only development version) ##
There was also an attempt by **anonymous** to build TorBOX 0.2.0-debootstrap. It has been dropped because there were too many issues. The open issues are noted within the files. **Never released.** If anyone wants to continue working on it that's certainly possible, let's discuss this on Whonix/Dev then.

[Old-development-only source code](https://sourceforge.net/projects/whonix/files/old-development-only/) has been archived.

## TorBOX 0.2.0-no-network-while-preseeding (only development version) ##
Based on TorBOX 0.2.0-debootstrap, there was also an attempt by **adrelanos** to create TorBOX 0.2.0-no-network-while-preseeding, which failed. **Never released.** (The goal was to save time while installing/preseeding.) That attempt failed, because of an issue with grub, see [https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-grub/2012-07/msg00008.html Wrong root device when using update-grub inside chroot (building VM images)]. Another issue was a limitation in preseed, see [http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2008/12/msg00159.html Problem trying to preseed netcfg/no_interfaces]. Build documentation was never written but the build script was self explainatory. If anyone wants to continue working on it that's certainly possible, let's discuss this on Whonix/Dev then.
