The [Whonix Framework](https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Security/#whonix-framework) supports any operating system.

***Using a default Whonix-Workstation provides more [Security]!***

The Whonix-Gateway already supports torification of any operating system, including Microsoft Windows and others. As an transparent or isolating proxy, see below for more information.

[TOC]

# Windows Whonix-Workstation #
XP, Vista and Windows 7 are tested and working. Not Recommended, because closed source and [Transparent Proxy Leaks](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxyLeaks). Depending on your preference, read all sub chapters.

## Easiest ##
Easiest, but least secure option.

(1). Download and use the default Whonix-Gateway.
(2). Create a Virtual Box VM.
(3). Switch Virtual Box VM settings network to internal network. (Important!)
(4). VM network settings internal network name: *Whonix* (Important!)
(5). Install Windows.
(6). Configure network:

For Windows 7 (similar in Windows XP): In Control Panel > Network and Sharing Center: click on "Change adapter settings"
Right-click on local area connection > properties
In property window: double-click Internet Protocol Version 4, use the following settings:

    IP address 192.168.0.11
    Subnet netmask 255.255.255.0
    Default gateway 192.168.0.10
    Preferred DNS server 192.168.0.10

## More security ##
Recommendations:

 * Install while the Virtual Machine has no internet connection.
 * Set your username to *user*.
 * Disable Internet Time Syncing.
 * Set your Time Zone to *UTC*.
 * Set up a static IP.
 * Read [Security].
 * Read the [Readme], (which is Whonix-Example-Implementation-Workstation (based on Debian GNU/Linux) specific) and try to apply as much from it to Windows as possible.

## Even more security ##
Recommendations:

 * Disable Whonix-Gateway's transparent proxy feature. Instead use your Windows Whonix-Workstation behind an isolating proxy. See [Identity correlation through circuit sharing](https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Applications/#identity-correlation-through-circuit-sharing) for more information.
 * Check your host clock out of band (use a watch or atomic clock).
 * Set your host and your Workstation clock to show seconds as well. After booting the Whonix-Windows-Workstation, add a random skew to your clock, maybe +/- 1 to 30 seconds. Optimal values are still under investigation. For reference, see [Whonix's Secure And Distributed Time Synchronization Mechanism](https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Security/#whonixs-secure-and-distributed-time-synchronization-mechanism), it's Whonix-Example-Implementation-Workstation (based on Debian GNU/Linux) specific, but most information also applies to Windows. Since I am not aware of a tails_htp alternative for Windows, you have to do it manually.

## Most security ##
Use the default Whonix VMs and build them yourself from source.

# Linux/BSD/any Whonix-Workstation #
Tested with Debian and Ubuntu.

Download and verify [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download) (or use a different install CD or iso file)

Create a new VM and choose following settings: Under Network set Adapter 1 to "Internal Network", rename "intnet" to "Whonix".

You can use the Live environment or install Ubuntu. When the installer asks questions, generally choose the default, most common or other non-identifying options. Language: English; keymap: choose yours (potentially risk...); Country (leave it as it is): United States; User Name: leave blank; Host Name (leave it as it is): ubuntu; Time Zone (change it): UTC (it's at the very bottom); Username (account name): user. This ensures that all Whonix users have the same settings. Additionally this is more safe, when an application leaks such data, such as SSH, if you simply ssh some.host.name, it will tell your current account name, and it would be very bad if this where you real name or anything which would identify you.

Reboot into the freshly installed system and open a terminal:

Remove Ubuntu's ?phone home? program (if installed). In a terminal type:

    sudo apt-get -y remove canonical-census

Dhcp auto-configuration like software such as network manager have to be removed, since we are using static networking.

    # Use with care!
    sudo apt-get remove dhcp*

Setup a fixed IP for the virtual LAN network card and to use the same subnet like the Whonix-Gateway for the Internal Network. If you use a Linux desktop with network manager you can use the GUI for this step. Otherwise: open a Terminal and type

    sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces

You only need to configure eth0:

    # This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
    # and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

    # The loopback network interface, leave as it is
    auto lo
    iface lo inet loopback

    auto eth0
    #iface eth0 inet dhcp
    iface eth0 inet static
    # increment last octet on additional workstations
           address 192.168.0.11
           netmask 255.255.255.0
           #network 192.168.0.0
           #broadcast 192.168.0.255
           gateway 192.168.0.10

Open /etc/resolv.conf.

    sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf

and delete everything, then add

    nameserver 192.168.0.10

If you forgot to set the time to UTC you can do so at any time by type the following into the terminal:

    sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata

Now would be a good time to create a snapshot of the VM.
