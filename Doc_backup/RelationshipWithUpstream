# Why this document? #
The [Debian Derivatives Guidelines](https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Guidelines) encourages "derivative distributions to mention and define their relationship with Debian". Because this seems like a great idea to me, I wrote this statement that not only covers
Whonix's relationship with Debian, but also Whonix's relationship with any
one of its upstream projects.

# Summary #
For various reasons Whonix tries to diverge by the smallest possible
amount from its upstream projects, and especially from Debian:

* Adrelanos wants to share his work with the rest of the Free Software
  community.
* Adrelanos values maintainability very much: I believe my users are best
  served if I keep the amount of work needed to maintain Whonix the
  smallest possible.

# How #
## Debian specific ##
### Infrastructure ###
Debian Derivatives Guidelines recommends *"We encourage derivative distributions to use Debian infrastructure and the software that powers Debian infrastructure where possible."*.

Whonix makes heavy use of that. Only official Debian repositories are used. Adrelanos is very thankful, that Debian derivatives are allowed to do so. The Whonix project has neither the infrastructure, the founding nor the manpower to run it's own repositories.

### Debian packages ###
Neither binary nor source packages are modified.

### Keyrings ###
Whonix does not modify keyrings.

Adrelanos's GPG key is copied into Whonix virtual machines at build time. It is only used to ensure authenticity of Whonix News.

### Releases ###
See [About Debian](http://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Security/#about-debian) for reasons to choose Wheezy. When Wheezy gets stable, Whonix will be based on stable. Depending on user feedback Whonix will remain based on stable. Depending on user feedback and stability of testing, Whonix might be based on testing.

### Trademark ###
Whonix is and will never be called Debian. It must always be clear that Whonix is a Debian derivative or based on Debian.

Adrelanos e-mailed trademark at debian.org and briefly explained Whonix. Debian Leader Stefano Zacchiroli said, there will be no trademark issues as long as Whonix will not claim to be Debian, which will of course never happen.

### De-/Re-branding ###
Not necessary. See Trademark above.

### Bug reports ###
Reportbug is unchanged. No Debian packages are modified. This still needs discussion.

### Popularity Contest ###
This still needs discussion. Currently not installed on Whonix. If it's possible to do in a privacy friendly way, adrelanos is interested to have add it to Whonix, at least as an opt-in.

## General ##
### Upstream software ###
When my technical skills and time allows, I try to push my changes upstream when we need to modify software I ship. Only package selection, configuration files and scripts are modified.

### Upstream Bug tracking systems ###
All bugs found in Whonix, will be checked, if they also apply to upstream. If that is the case, adrelanos will look if the bug has already been reported. If adrelanos can contribute something constructive, he will do so. In case there is not yet a bug report, adrelanos will report.

The same goes for wishlist/enhancement requests.
