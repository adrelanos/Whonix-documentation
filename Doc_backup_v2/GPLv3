<h1 id="gnu-general-public-license">GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h1>
<p>Version 3, 29 June 2007</p>
<p>Copyright &copy; 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;<a href="http://fsf.org/" rel="nofollow">http://fsf.org/</a>&gt;</p>
<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license<br />
document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>
<p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other<br />
kinds of works.</p>
<p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away<br />
your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public<br />
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a<br />
program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free<br />
Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it<br />
applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to<br />
your programs, too.</p>
<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General<br />
Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute<br />
copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source<br />
code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of<br />
it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>
<p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or<br />
asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if<br />
you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to<br />
respect the freedom of others.</p>
<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee,<br />
you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make<br />
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these<br />
terms so they know their rights.</p>
<p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert<br />
copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission<br />
to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p>
<p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is<br />
no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL<br />
requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not<br />
be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.</p>
<p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of<br />
the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally<br />
incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The<br />
systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br />
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed<br />
this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems<br />
arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to<br />
those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of<br />
users.</p>
<p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should<br />
not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose<br />
computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents<br />
applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the<br />
GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p>
<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</p>
<h2 id="terms-and-conditions">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>
<h3 id="0-definitions">0. Definitions.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;This License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Copyright&rdquo; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br />
works, such as semiconductor masks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Program&rdquo; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br />
License. Each licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;. &ldquo;Licensees&rdquo; and<br />
&ldquo;recipients&rdquo; may be individuals or organizations.</p>
<p>To &ldquo;modify&rdquo; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in<br />
a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The<br />
resulting work is called a &ldquo;modified version&rdquo; of the earlier work or a<br />
work &ldquo;based on&rdquo; the earlier work.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;covered work&rdquo; means either the unmodified Program or a work based on<br />
the Program.</p>
<p>To &ldquo;propagate&rdquo; a work means to do anything with it that, without<br />
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under<br />
applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private<br />
copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),<br />
making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>
<p>To &ldquo;convey&rdquo; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br />
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer<br />
network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>
<p>An interactive user interface displays &ldquo;Appropriate Legal Notices&rdquo; to the<br />
extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1)<br />
displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no<br />
warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that<br />
licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this<br />
License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br />
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p>
<h3 id="1-source-code">1. Source Code.</h3>
<p>The &ldquo;source code&rdquo; for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br />
making modifications to it. &ldquo;Object code&rdquo; means any non-source form of a<br />
work.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Standard Interface&rdquo; means an interface that either is an official<br />
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces<br />
specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among<br />
developers working in that language.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;System Libraries&rdquo; of an executable work include anything, other than<br />
the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major<br />
Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to<br />
enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard<br />
Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.<br />
A &ldquo;Major Component&rdquo;, in this context, means a major essential component<br />
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which<br />
the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code<br />
interpreter used to run it.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a work in object code form means all the<br />
source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object<br />
code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However,<br />
it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or<br />
generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those<br />
activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source<br />
includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and<br />
the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work<br />
is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or<br />
control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.</p>
<p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate<br />
automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.</p>
<p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.</p>
<h3 id="2-basic-permissions">2. Basic Permissions.</h3>
<p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the<br />
Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License<br />
explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The<br />
output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output,<br />
given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights<br />
of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p>
<p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without<br />
conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered<br />
works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively<br />
for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you<br />
comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not<br />
control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so<br />
exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit<br />
them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship<br />
with you.</p>
<p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions<br />
stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.</p>
<h3 id="3-protecting-users-legal-rights-from-anti-circumvention-law">3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</h3>
<p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any<br />
applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty<br />
adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention<br />
of such measures.</p>
<p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of<br />
technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising<br />
rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any<br />
intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing,<br />
against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention<br />
of technological measures.</p>
<h3 id="4-conveying-verbatim-copies">4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</h3>
<p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any<br />
medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br />
appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and<br />
any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep<br />
intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of<br />
this License along with the Program.</p>
<p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer<br />
support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>
<h3 id="5-conveying-modified-source-versions">5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</h3>
<p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from<br />
the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that<br />
you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a<br />
relevant date.</li>
<li>b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this<br />
License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the<br />
requirement in section 4 to &ldquo;keep intact all notices&rdquo;.</li>
<li>c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who<br />
comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any<br />
applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br />
regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the<br />
work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have<br />
separately received it.</li>
<li>d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal<br />
Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display<br />
Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are<br />
not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with<br />
it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution<br />
medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the compilation and its resulting<br />
copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br />
beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate<br />
does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.</p>
<h3 id="6-conveying-non-source-forms">6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</h3>
<p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and<br />
5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the<br />
terms of this License, in one of these ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a<br />
physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a<br />
durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.</li>
<li>b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a<br />
physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least<br />
three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for<br />
that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of<br />
the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this<br />
License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for<br />
a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of<br />
source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no<br />
charge.</li>
<li>c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to<br />
provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and<br />
noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in<br />
accord with subsection 6b.</li>
<li>d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for<br />
a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way<br />
through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy<br />
the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object<br />
code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server<br />
(operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities,<br />
provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find<br />
the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source,<br />
you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy<br />
these requirements.</li>
<li>e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform<br />
other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being<br />
offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.</li>
</ul>
<p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the<br />
Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the<br />
object code work.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;User Product&rdquo; is either (1) a &ldquo;consumer product&rdquo;, which<br />
means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or<br />
household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a<br />
dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases<br />
shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a<br />
particular user, &ldquo;normally used&rdquo; refers to a typical or common use of<br />
that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way<br />
in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the<br />
product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has<br />
substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br />
the only significant mode of use of the product.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Installation Information&rdquo; for a User Product means any methods,<br />
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute<br />
modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of<br />
its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued<br />
functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with<br />
solely because modification has been made.</p>
<p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for<br />
use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which<br />
the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient<br />
in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is<br />
characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be<br />
accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if<br />
neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code<br />
on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).</p>
<p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to<br />
continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been<br />
modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been<br />
modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself<br />
materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules<br />
and protocols for communication across the network.</p>
<p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with<br />
this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an<br />
implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no<br />
special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.</p>
<h3 id="7-additional-terms">7. Additional Terms.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Additional permissions&rdquo; are terms that supplement the terms of this<br />
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional<br />
permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they<br />
were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable<br />
law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be<br />
used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br />
this License without regard to the additional permissions.</p>
<p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any<br />
additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional<br />
permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you<br />
modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a<br />
covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a<br />
covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)<br />
supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of<br />
sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</li>
<li>b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author<br />
attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works<br />
containing it; or</li>
<li>c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that<br />
modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the<br />
original version; or</li>
<li>d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the<br />
material; or</li>
<li>e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names,<br />
trademarks, or service marks; or</li>
<li>f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone<br />
who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of<br />
liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions<br />
directly impose on those licensors and authors.</li>
</ul>
<p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &ldquo;further<br />
restrictions&rdquo; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received<br />
it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License<br />
along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a<br />
license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying<br />
under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of<br />
that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such<br />
relicensing or conveying.</p>
<p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in<br />
the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those<br />
files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.</p>
<p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a<br />
separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply<br />
either way.</p>
<h3 id="8-termination">8. Termination.</h3>
<p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under<br />
this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will<br />
automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses<br />
granted under the third paragraph of section 11).</p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a<br />
particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the<br />
copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently,<br />
if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br />
prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently<br />
if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this<br />
is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any<br />
work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br />
your receipt of the notice.</p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of<br />
parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your<br />
rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to<br />
receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.</p>
<h3 id="9-acceptance-not-required-for-having-copies">9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</h3>
<p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the<br />
Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of<br />
using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require<br />
acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to<br />
propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not<br />
accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you<br />
indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p>
<h3 id="10-automatic-licensing-of-downstream-recipients">10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</h3>
<p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license<br />
from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this<br />
License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this<br />
License.</p>
<p>An &ldquo;entity transaction&rdquo; is a transaction transferring control of an<br />
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or<br />
merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity<br />
transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also<br />
receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or<br />
could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br />
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor<br />
has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p>
<p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or<br />
affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty,<br />
or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not<br />
initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging<br />
that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or<br />
importing the Program or any portion of it.</p>
<h3 id="11-patents">11. Patents.</h3>
<p>A &ldquo;contributor&rdquo; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br />
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus<br />
licensed is called the contributor's &ldquo;contributor version&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A contributor's &ldquo;essential patent claims&rdquo; are all patent claims owned or<br />
controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that<br />
would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or<br />
selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed<br />
only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For<br />
purposes of this definition, &ldquo;control&rdquo; includes the right to grant patent<br />
sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.</p>
<p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license<br />
under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale,<br />
import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor<br />
version.</p>
<p>In the following three paragraphs, a &ldquo;patent license&rdquo; is any express<br />
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an<br />
express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent<br />
infringement). To &ldquo;grant&rdquo; such a patent license to a party means to make<br />
such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.</p>
<p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the<br />
Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge<br />
and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or<br />
other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding<br />
Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br />
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with<br />
the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream<br />
recipients. &ldquo;Knowingly relying&rdquo; means you have actual knowledge that, but<br />
for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your<br />
recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more<br />
identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p>
<p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you<br />
convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent<br />
license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,<br />
propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent<br />
license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and<br />
works based on it.</p>
<p>A patent license is &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo; if it does not include within the<br />
scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the<br />
non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this<br />
License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with<br />
a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make<br />
payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the<br />
work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive<br />
the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with<br />
copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b)<br />
primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain<br />
the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license<br />
was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p>
<p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied<br />
license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you<br />
under applicable patent law.</p>
<h3 id="12-no-surrender-of-others-freedom">12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</h3>
<p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)<br />
that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the<br />
conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy<br />
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent<br />
obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you<br />
agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from<br />
those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms<br />
and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p>
<h3 id="13-use-with-the-gnu-affero-general-public-license">13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or<br />
combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero<br />
General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.<br />
The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered<br />
work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section<br />
13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.</p>
<h3 id="14-revised-versions-of-this-license">14. Revised Versions of this License.</h3>
<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU<br />
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit<br />
to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that<br />
a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License &ldquo;or any later<br />
version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<br />
conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the<br />
Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU<br />
General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free<br />
Software Foundation.</p>
<p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU<br />
General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a<br />
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.</p>
<p>Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no<br />
additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of<br />
your choosing to follow a later version.</p>
<h3 id="15-disclaimer-of-warranty">15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</h3>
<p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br />
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br />
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER<br />
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br />
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE<br />
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE<br />
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
<h3 id="16-limitation-of-liability">16. Limitation of Liability.</h3>
<p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY<br />
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS<br />
PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,<br />
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br />
PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE<br />
OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE<br />
WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br />
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
<h3 id="17-interpretation-of-sections-15-and-16">17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</h3>
<p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be<br />
given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local<br />
law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in<br />
connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies<br />
a copy of the Program in return for a fee.</p>
<p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
<h2 id="how-to-apply-these-terms-to-your-new-programs">How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h2>
<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to<br />
the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone<br />
can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>
<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them<br />
to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty;<br />
and each file should have at least the &ldquo;copyright&rdquo; line and a pointer to<br />
where the full notice is found.</p>
