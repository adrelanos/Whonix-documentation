# Why do you need anonymity? #
As you are probably aware of, we currently find ourselves in a state of steady decline of our freedoms and privacy, with increasing levels of mass surveillance and repression all over the world (see [this report from Privacy International](http://www.privacyinternational.org/article.shtml?cmd%5B347%5D=x-347-559597)).

Without taking any precautions, your Internet service provider, the State, the police and global surveillance systems like [ECHELON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON) (which is _not_ a conspiracy theory; see [this report from the European Parliament](http://www.fas.org/irp/program/process/rapport_echelon_en.pdf)) can record what you do online: what you read, what you write and who you communicate with.

This is possible since all messages sent over the Internet contain the [IP addresses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ip_address) of both the sender and receiver, much like an ordinary mail sent through the postal system contains addresses of both sender and receiver for two-ways communication. IP addresses can easily be traced back to the physical location of the computers and their owners, and from that ultimately back to you.

If you do not mind this fact, then more power to you, but if you do mind, then Whonix might be just what you need.

Moreover, just like with a postcard, any information traveling on the Internet can be read by many computers that relay them.

The Tor Project prepared a page [Who uses Tor](https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en) in case you are interested.
