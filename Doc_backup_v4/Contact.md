# Contacting Whonix developers / Feedback / Questions #
At the moment there is only one active Whonix developer: adrelanos (aka proper). You'll get an answer, but please be patient.

Please do use e-mail for reporting security vulnerabilities!

For anything else:

## For users ##
Preferred: [Whonix forum at sourceforge.org](https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/). Anonymous and registered postings possible. ^1^

e-mail: *adrelanos at riseup do net*
(GPG ^2^)

## For developers ##
Preferred: [Developer Mailing List](https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/mailman/).

e-mail: *adrelanos at riseup do net*
(GPG ^2^)

## For Press #
e-mail: *adrelanos at riseup do net*
(GPG ^2^)

I would appreciate if you could send me your draft before publishing it. This is not a request. It's an offer. I would proofread it, state where I think something is incorrect and add sources to my claims. It dislike to pressure press. You are free to write what you want. I feel free to post my standpoint in public if I feel otherwise about something.

## For private inquiries ##
e-mail: *adrelanos at riseup do net*
(GPG ^2^)

## Social Media #
There are some [Whonix Social Media Profiles](https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/OnlineProfiles/), but please don't rely on them for getting Whonix News and please don't use them to contact Whonix developers.

If you don't get into trouble, by letting others to know, that you like or use Whonix, feel free to follow or like those profiles (with your anonymous account) as a little way to [Contribute].
