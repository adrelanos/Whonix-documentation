# JonDo

JonDo can already be used over Tor when it's installed inside Whonix-Workstation (user -> Tor -> JonDo), see [JonDonym].

Installing it by default.... I don't know. Only one person asked about JonDo... I am not very positive that JonDo will be pre-installed on Whonix-Workstation by default, although I am not totally against it.

All software in Whonix by default should be able to update itself (or at least inform that it's outdated so it can be updated with only one command, such as torbrowser). I don't know if their Debian repository works for Debian Wheezy, which Whonix is based on. Can you test it please?

I also wouldn't know what happens if they replace their signing key.

As Whonix developer I can't really support the JonDo software. I don't have time to build JonDo from source code and ship a new build of Whonix each time JonDo gets updated.

They have their own instructions in on their homepage and those may change over time. If follow their instructions and pre-install it and they change the instructions, Whonix users will still have the outdated versions. What should I do in that case? Post in important blog "now follow these command line instructions and get JonDo updated if you use it"?

So this almost always requires either to offload installing it to the user or some cooperation from the original software project.

Whonix is also [quite simple](https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/FAQ/#does-whonix-modify-tor) at the moment and I don't know how the project would be perceived if Tor Browser and JonDoFox were installed by default.

Building Whonix from source code, custom builds are always possible. To make this happen, it needs someone deeply caring about JonDo and contributing to Whonix. Otherwise it's very unlikely.
