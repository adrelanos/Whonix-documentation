![Whonix Concept](https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/screenshot/whonix.jpg)

Whonix is an anonymous general purpose operating system based on Virtual Box, Debian GNU/Linux and Tor. By Whonix design, IP and DNS leaks are impossible. Not even malware with root rights can find out the user's real IP/location.

This is because Whonix consists of two (virtual) machines. One machine solely runs Tor and acts as a gateway, which we call Whonix-Gateway. The other machine, which we call Whonix-Workstation, is on a completely isolated network. Only connections through Tor are possible.

This is only a very brief introduction. See [Documentation](https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Documentation/) and/or [Technical Design](https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Design/) for a more comprehensive description, security features and threat model. To find out how secure/anonymous Whonix is, see [Security Overview](https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Technical%20Introduction/#security-overview).
