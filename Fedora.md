# Fedora
Consideration for recommending Fedora as host operating system...

Website

* Looks much more friendly and modern.
* It's available over SSL.
* [verification instructions](https://fedoraproject.org/en/verify) are also available over SSL.
* gpg signing key is available over SSL.

Package Manager

* yum is safe as apt according to the theupdateframework.com people

Consideration for using it as Virtual Machine Guest

(i.e. for Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation)

* Is there a tool to create virtual machine images like there is grml-debootstrap for Debian?

Other stuff.

* Has not been considered yet.
