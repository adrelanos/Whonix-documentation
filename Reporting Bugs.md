# Reporting Bugs #
## Normal Bugs ##
At the moment Whonix has very few bugs and only one developer. Adrelanos feels there is no need for a formal bug tracking system. Simply post bugs to the [User Help Forum](https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/).

They will be reproduced, confirmed, discussed, workaround posted, fixed in Whonix source code, etc. as fast as possible.

## Security Vulnerabilities ##
It would be nice if you were to report the bug privately through gpg encrypted mail before publishing it. That would allow adrelanos to fix the bug and to credit your findings after the next Whonix release.

See [Contacting Whonix developers / Feedback / Questions](https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Contact/).
