# Security Reviews and Feedback
If you want to get listed here or feel something is missing, please get in contact.

## Audits
 * [cursory check of TorBOX by creator of JanusVM](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-March/023531.html)

## Official expert review
None, but that doesn't mean anything. There is nothing of that kind about Tails or Libert√© Linux as well. Is there even something of that kind about Debian, Ubuntu or Qubes OS?

I am not aware of any serious research about any of such distributions in [anonbib](http://freehaven.net/anonbib/). No one like [Bruce Schneier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Schneier) for cryptography exists for distribution review.

If you make an audit, please contact me and I will link it here.

## Online Profiles
There are some [OnlineProfiles].

## First public discussions
There are [a few older threads](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-March/subject.html#23489) on the Tor Talk Mailing List about the security of Whonix / transparent proxy.

* [tor-talk] Operating system updates / software installation behind Tor Transparent Proxy"
* [tor-talk] Obtain real IP behind Tor transparent proxy; was: Operating system updates / software installation behind Tor Transparent Proxy
* [tor-talk] Risk with transparent proxy mode [was Re:Operating system updates / software installation behind Tor Transparent Proxy] - Summary: coderman (developer of TorVM / JanusVM) had some concerns, which could be cleared. "Looks fine form a cursory check."

## Older places of people talking about Whonix
A section to collect everyone discussing Whonix anywere. It's nice to see what people think and say about Whonix. If they don't give feedback directly, we still have a secondary feedback source. Most links are found through googeling "TorBOX" or "https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBOX".

Old questions on torproject.org:

* [Dev/ArchivedDiscussion/QUESTIONS](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBOX/Dev/ArchivedDiscussion/QUESTIONS)

Unsorted:

* ["My Hidden Blog"](http://utup22qsb6ebeejs.onion/?x=entry:entry120219-220943); (adrelanos) small blog entry; unfortunately not much information or feedback
* [Whonix on theprivatebay.de](https://thepiratebay.se/tag/torbox); (adrelanos) Interesting but pointless imo. 6 seeders right now in total. People should not even trust us but they trust the packager of that torrent. I am not against sharing through torrent. It's all Free Software. As long we do not offer trusted and gpg signed builds, however I recommend against downloading through torrent.
* [Whonix on wilderssecurity.com](https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=site%3Awilderssecurity.com+TorBOX); few threads
* [ra's blog](http://ra.fnord.at/2011/05/easy-and-secure-anonymous-internet-usage/); Search for "TorBOX that they have".; Negative feedback.
* LulzSec / AntiSecOp: [Want to be a ghost on the internet?](https://www.facebook.com/notes/lulzsec/want-to-be-a-ghost-on-the-internet/230293097062823?_fb_noscript=1) or google for 'Want to be a ghost on the internet?'; Whonix (TorBOX) is a part of their instructions.
