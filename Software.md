## Printing and scanning ##
Printing is risky. This is not a Whonix related issues. It is a general issue with printers.

Quotes from [eff.org](https://www.eff.org/issues/printers):
*"Imagine that every time you printed a document it automatically included a secret code that could be used to identify the printer - and potentially the person who used it. Sounds like something from an episode of "Alias " right?*

*Unfortunately the scenario isn't fictional."*

I don't know if scanners also add such a kind of extra hidden data.

If you want to be secure side, buy an extra printer/scanner, which you only use for anonymous activity.

Another non-technical issue with anonymous printing nowadays is forensic, fingerprint, DNA, etc.

## scurl - SSL command line downloader ##
**Advanced users.**

scurl comes with next Whonix version 0.5.x.

It's a simple wrapper account curl. */usr/local/bin/scurl* takes precedence over /usr/bin/curl and simply adds "*--tlsv1 --proto =https*" to all runs of curl. It also has [Stream Isolation] in Whonix, because */usr/local/bin/curl* takes precedence over */usr/bin/curl*.

To invoke it.

    scurl https://check.torproject.org

All other curl/linux features continue to work, such as.

    scurl https://check.torproject.org > index.html

To store the output inside a file.

    scurl http://check.torproject.org

Will result as expected in.

    curl: (1) Protocol http not supported or disabled in libcurl

Same for.

    scurl check.torproject.org

Will result as expected in.

    curl: (1) Protocol http not supported or disabled in libcurl

Running it against an self-signed or invalid SSL certificate.

    scurl https://www.debian-administration.org

Will result in an error, for example.

    curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: self signed certificate
    More details here: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html

    curl performs SSL certificate verification by default, using a "bundle"
     of Certificate Authority (CA) public keys (CA certs). If the default
     bundle file isn't adequate, you can specify an alternate file
     using the --cacert option.
    If this HTTPS server uses a certificate signed by a CA represented in
     the bundle, the certificate verification probably failed due to a
     problem with the certificate (it might be expired, or the name might
     not match the domain name in the URL).
    If you'd like to turn off curl's verification of the certificate, use
     the -k (or --insecure) option.
