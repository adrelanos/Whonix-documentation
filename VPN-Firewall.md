# Fail Closed Mechanism #
This is not a Whonix specific problem. It is a general problem with VPNs. Most users are simply not aware of it. VPN's generally fail open. VPN servers and VPN software can occasionally break down without announcement. This means, if the VPN is unreachable, connections breaks down for whatever reasons and so on, in most cases, you can continue to connect to the internet without the VPN.

If you want to enforce, that the VPN gets always used, see:
