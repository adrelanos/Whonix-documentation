## Video Help ##
View the Videos in your browser or download them.

### View in your Browser ###
You can view those videos in Mozilla Firefox or with the Tor Browser Bundle. They are hosted on archive.org. These are html 5 videos in webm format. <font size="-3">You do **not** require flash, although archive.org allows viewing them with Flash as well.</font>
You need to authorize html 5 twice with Tor Browser and you need a tiny bit patience until they finished loading, around 15 to 20 seconds.

### Download Videos ###
Alternatively you could also download them from sourceforge.
