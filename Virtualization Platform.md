# Virtualization Platform #
*Whonix Example Implementation* is based on Virtual Box. There is a dev discussion about switching to a more secure Virtualization Platform and help is required.

In an ideal world, *Whonix Example Implementation* would support all Virtualization Platforms. Theoretically it could be done using [libvirt](http://libvirt.org/). Practically  libvirt is out of question. [libvirt-users Does libvirt abstract each and any vm specific command?](https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvirt-users/2012-August/msg00150.html) Libvirt does not (yet) abstract some commands Whonix depends on.

See [OtherVirtualizationPlatforms] for more.
