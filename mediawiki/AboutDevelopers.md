= About Developers =

Whonix initially has been created by (at least) three people, see [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Authorship/#authors Authors]. A lot other people reserve credit, as outlined on the [Authorship] page. Please carefully read the [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Authorship/#disclaimer Disclaimer].

Documenting what Whonix does and what Whonix does not do is more a task for documenting what it does not do. Quoted form the [About] page: &quot;Remember, Whonix is based on Debian, KDE, VirtualBox, Tor and Tor Browser. It is nothing very special. To oversimplify it: Whonix is just a collection of configuration files. <sup>1</sup>&quot;

The result (Whoinix) creates a picture in some people's minds that adrelanos (Whonix developer) must be similar to Tor developers a genius and expert for all kinds of technical topics. The facts are quite the opposite...

adrelanos:

* Has initiated the TorBOX project, which was later renamed to Whonix. (See [History].)
* Initially had some help by (at least) two different people.
* Many improvements are based on reading documentation, papers, researching, stating questions, discussion, communication with the community.

What adrelanos is NOT an expert for:

* Tor source code
* Tor anonymity
* Security
* Vulnerabilities
* Exploits
* Hardening
* ...

Creating Whonix was quite simple and you'll see it yourself if you care to read the source code and technical design. There was a learning curve involved and time investment. That does NOT make me automatically an expert in all kinds of topics.
