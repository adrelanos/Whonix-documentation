= DISCLAIMER =

== General ==

''''''DISCLAIMER:'''''' The authors accept NO responsibility for any leaks, faults, detection, incarceration, torture, etc; as a result of your use of Whonix. NO WARRANTY expressed or implied.

We have done our best to create this project, but we are not programmers, network experts, tor expert, lawyer, etc; Just a Tor user who have done extensive research on Google. Be careful, use your brain, trust no one but yourself.

== Whonix VPN disclaimer ==

You only have to read this chapter, when you are going to combine Whonix with a VPN.

Whonix is in no way affiliated with any VPN provider.

The mentioned VPN providers on other wiki pages have been chosen, because we found them, it was easy to register, no personal information were required and because it was free. Whonix developers do not review or rate VPN providers, that is beyond the Whonix project. You are welcome to post instructions for other free VPN services, which will be treated equally. In no way any provider is labeled as a good/bad choice.

Depending on what they were used for, they also fulfilled certain criteria, which are mentioned in the specific article. For example: TCP connection supported; not blocking UDP ports; OpenVPN supported, many other free providers offered only access through proprietary, closed source and/or windows-only clients.

Most websites recommend for choosing a good VPN: 1. Do not use free VPNs, as they observe you, log everything and sell you. 2. Leave no money trail, pay anonymously. (Bitcoin etc.) ([https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Money/ Anonymous Money page]) 3. Research their reputation, background, history, location. 4. Check their privacy policy and terms of service. 5. They shouldn't ask for any identifying information. (name, postal address, e-mail etc.) 6. The providers homepage is reachable over http'''s''' with a valid SSL certificate. 7. You can use GPG to mail them. ([https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Software/#encrypt-decrypt-sign-and-verify-text-using-openpgp-gnupg-frontend gpg mail encryption chapter]) 8. They offer to use their service with a VPN software, which secure and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software Free Software], such as OpenVPN.

Use at your own risk.
