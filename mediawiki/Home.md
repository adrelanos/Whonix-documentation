Whonix is an anonymous general purpose operating system based on Virtual Box, Debian GNU/Linux and Tor. By Whonix design, IP and DNS leaks are impossible. Not even malware with root rights can find out the user's real IP/location.

This is because Whonix consists of two (virtual) machines. One machine solely runs Tor and acts as a gateway, which we call Whonix-Gateway. The other machine, which we call Whonix-Workstation, is on a completely isolated network. Only connections through Tor are possible.

This is only a very brief introduction. See [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Documentation/ Documentation] and/or [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Design/ Technical Design] for a more comprehensive description, security features and threat model. To find out how secure/anonymous Whonix is, see [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Technical%20Introduction/#security-overview Security Overview].

Whonix is produced independently from the TorÂ® anonymity software and carries no guarantee from The Tor Project about quality, suitability or anything else.|
