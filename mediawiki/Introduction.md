= Introduction =

Whonix in default settings provides more security than Tor alone. Anonymity is a complex problem and there is no easy solution to a complex problems. The more you know, the safer and the more anonymous you can be. Whonix provides loads of documentation of the interested people.

Anonymity isn't a program or setup, it's a process, new knowledge is being gathered as we speak.

The goal of this documentation is to present The Whonix Anonymous Operating System in an easy to understand and reasonably thorough manner in hope to give the new user a crash course in what might be a completely new set of applications and concepts regarding anonymity and security on the Internet.

It will '''not''' fully document the applications included in Whonix, but rather give an overview of them and go on details only on the Whonix-specific configuration.

It is quite long so you might want to not read it in one go but instead read [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/About/ About], [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Warning/ Warning], [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Download/ Download] as well as the [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Documentation/ Documentation] sections on only those aspects you intend to use with the possibility to return to it whenever you want to try something new or use it for reference.

By offering you Whonix we hope that you have the technological means to stay anonymous on the Internet. However, we want to emphasize that staying anonymous is not only a technological problem â€“ there is no tool, including Whonix and Tor, that will magically make you anonymous on the Internet. You will have to behave as well. While deep technical knowledge of the architecture of the Internet, cryptology, traffic analysis techniques and the applications you use certainly can help (mainly by knowing what not to do), we believe that some basic knowledge and good old fashioned common sense and caution will be enough in most cases.

Introduction chapters should be read. Let's suppose you are interested in &quot;''i2p over Tor''&quot;, then the introduction topic in &quot;''Accessing Other Anonymizing Services over Tor''&quot; should be read and as well obviously the &quot;''i2p''&quot; chapter.

<font size="-3">Small text</font> is not that crucial. It contains clarification, source of information, extra information for people with even higher security needs, people with doubt, proof for something, etc. It's not that bad if you don't understand it as a beginner. I'd be happy if you are that interested and read it as well.
