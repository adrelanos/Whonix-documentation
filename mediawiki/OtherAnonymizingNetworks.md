Whonix can work together with any other suited Anonymizing Networks. This means the other network will be tunneled through Tor.

<font size="-3"> '''In theory''' also Tor could be completely exchanged with any other suited anonymizing network, see [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Technical%20Introduction/#whonix-framework Whonix Framework]. Development in this area stalled due to lack of interest from users, upstream developers and Whonix developers. Anyway, there has been some research, theoretical and practical work done towards such integration, see [Inspiration] in case you are interested. </font>

'''Note that all networks differ in their threat model and security! Research before you start using them.'''

== Rudimentary Whonix Support for Other Anonymizing Networks ==

<font size="-3"> The [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Security/#whonix-framework Whonix Framework] is agnostic about which Anonymizing Network is being used. Whonix started with Tor as anonymizing network, because all developers were Tor users. The idea, that also other anonymizing network could be used, came much later.

At the moment Whonix's support for Other Anonymizing Networks is only rudimentary and not as good as supported like the Tor network. Of course Whonix developers respect other anonymizing networks, their developers and their users. They are simply more accustomed to the Tor network, which is also a personal preference. It's also very hard to be equally interested, educated and to stay up to date with all other anonymizing networks at the same time.

As soon as a new developer, who actively supports the other anonymizing network, joins the Whonix project, this particular anonymizing network can be equally supported like the Tor network. For example, there is not much point in separate a 'JonDoBOX', if most of the knowledge and code is shared. </font>
