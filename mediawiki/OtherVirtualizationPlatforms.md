In theory, Whonix could run inside any virtualizer, because its build scripts are very modular and extensible. In reality, Whonix has no man power to test other virtualizers than Virtual Box. As soon as contributors join the project an maintain support for other virtualizers, support for them can most likely be easily added.

Some partially finished attempts:

* [VMware] (proof of concept)
* Qubes OS as host operating system would be most interesting. It just needs someone sufficiently motivated to do a little work to make it reality, see blog post [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/featureblog/2013/02/running-whonix-on-top-of-qubes-os-anyone-interested-unpacking-ova-images/ Running Whonix on top of Qubes OS, anyone interested?.].
* [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/c0090dde/ Qemu / Virt-Manager] successful report in the forums
