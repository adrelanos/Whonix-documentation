* [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-March/023531.html cursory check of TorBOX by creator of JanusVM]

== Official expert review ==

None, but that doesn't mean anything. There is nothing of that kind about Tails or Libert√© Linux as well. Is there even something of that kind about Debian, Ubuntu or Qubes OS?

I am not aware of any serious research about any of such distributions in [http://freehaven.net/anonbib/ anonbib]. No one like [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Schneier Bruce Schneier] for cryptography exists for distribution review.

If you make an audit, please contact me and I will link it here.

== Online Profiles ==

There are some [OnlineProfiles].

== First public discussions ==

There are [https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-March/subject.html#23489 a few older threads] on the Tor Talk Mailing List about the security of Whonix / transparent proxy.

== Older places of people talking about Whonix ==

A section to collect everyone discussing Whonix anywere. It's nice to see what people think and say about Whonix. If they don't give feedback directly, we still have a secondary feedback source. Most links are found through googeling &quot;TorBOX&quot; or &quot;https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBOX&quot;.

* [https://thepiratebay.se/tag/torbox Whonix on theprivatebay.de]; (adrelanos) Interesting but pointless imo. 6 seeders right now in total. People should not even trust us but they trust the packager of that torrent. I am not against sharing through torrent. It's all Free Software. As long we do not offer trusted and gpg signed builds, however I recommend against downloading through torrent.
* [https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=site%3Awilderssecurity.com+TorBOX Whonix on wilderssecurity.com]; few threads
* [http://ra.fnord.at/2011/05/easy-and-secure-anonymous-internet-usage/ ra's blog]; Search for &quot;TorBOX that they have&quot;.; Negative feedback.
