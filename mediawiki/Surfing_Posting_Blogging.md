= Anonymous Surfing, Posting and Blogging =

== Introduction ==

Tor Browser is installed to surf the Internet anonymously. It is optimized to surf the Web securely and anonymously and therefore configured in a rather restricitve way. Please, read the [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/TorBrowser/ Tor Browser] article for basics.

== Posting, Blogging anonymously ==

Whonix-Workstation contains all necessary tools to run a blog anonymously. Some hints:

* For a anonymous blog you need a new and anonymous e-mail address (see separate [E-Mail] article] for registering the blog and possibly the communicationi first. Register a new address and use this address only in regard to your blog. Always use Tor to login into this e-mail account.
* You may register your blog at different providers anonymously. For example you could use https://wordpress.com/. Keep always the option to pay anonymously (e.g via BitCoin or cash cards, ex. Paysafecard) in mind if you are using a premium product. (See [Money] page.) Note, that cash card codes differ by country and could theoretically also contain an ID to specific in which shop they have been bought. Usually you may administrate your blog using a web interface only. Always use Tor for all activities concerning your blog.
* A browser is no safe environment to write stuff. You could accidentally paste things you don't want to paste. While you type, the server already knows what you type. It's another question if they are already collecting and using that information. It's better to be careful. Otherwise it would reveal, how fast you type, how long your breaks are, which mistakes you make while writing the draft and while you mistype, also which type of local keyboard you are using. Write the text in an offline text editor such as KWrite and copy and paste the text into the blog interface once you are done.
* Every blog software offers the option to select the point in time when new postings shall be published. Do not publish a new posting &quot;at once&quot; but rather choose a point in time when you are not online anymore. <sup>1</sup>
* Generally, before uploading to the blog pictures and other documents must get anonymized. Usually, pictures contain a unique camera id in the meta tags, which may deanonymize you, and perhaps GPS (location) coordinates. See [Metadata] for more information.
* Stylometry (deanonymization using your spelling style) is already an inherent part of secret service means. It is possible using (semi) automatic techniques to correlate anonymous postings to an author if the circle of suspects is sufficient small and if there are enough text examples of them. Concentrating and taking one's time while writing a blog post allow to fake one's spelling style though.
* Use a spell checker to confuse Stylometry a bit. You could use KWrite. To start it, use Start menu button -&gt; Applications -&gt; Utilities -&gt; Text Editor (KWrite). Once KWrite is open, click on Tools -&gt; Automatic spell checking. Mistyped words will be underlined with red color.

<font size="-3"> ,, <sup>1</sup> This will trick adversaries, who can not force the the blog service provider to reveal the fact, when and for how long you log in. It won't trick the blog service provider. </font>
