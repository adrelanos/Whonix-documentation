= Surveillance Capabilities =

In order to develop proper means for anonymity, one must therefore estimate this technological capacities of adversaries (typically, corporate, criminals, repressive government). If you are not too technologically or scientifically educated, or if signal intelligence sounds somewhat mythical to you, then you will be rather challenged to properly assess such a capability, distinguishing facts from fantasy.

First, some simple overview. A highly technologically capable authority (e.g., a military counter-intelligence unit) can:

* intercept your internet traffic, including e-mail, instant messaging, VoIP, and Wi-Fi connections (the latter doesn't involve ISPs)
* intercept your phone and fax communication, including landlines, cell phones, satellite phones, and radio telephone extensions (the latter doesn't involve Telcos)
* associate your geographic location with a cell phone IMEI number or with a SIM card number
* reliably associate your calls with your voice patterns (speaker recognition)
* associate your geographic location with your digital financial transactions

This passive surveillance can be performed constantly and concurrently for a large number of people (who are not specifically suspect of anything), and all data gathered can be retained indefinitely. We see that the technological resources of a modern authority are virtually unlimited, and any task that can be automated is implemented and engaged.

However, the non-technological resources of an authority are definitely limited. The authority cannot:

* break modern encryption protocols
* perform active surveillance on non-suspects (e.g., break into computers)
* have officers or employees read / listen to large amounts of communication
* recognize your face from a satellite (although [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle UAV] is a different story)
* have qualified human resources in big quantities.
