== Introduction ==

To try to explain it in layman's terms, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS rss] is http link, which you can use to get notified when a update on a website, such as a blog has been posted.

== rss Reader in Whonix ==

Whonix 0.5.5 and above comes with the rss reader, [http://offog.org/code/rawdog.html rawdog], pre-configured and for the main reason to fetch Whonix News Blog in a privacy friendly way. <sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup> <sup>3</sup> <sup>4</sup>

Rawdog is not that user friendly, because it does not have a graphical user interface. For Whonix News Blog it should work quite well, because the configuration work can be done by Whonix developer.

A recommendation for a privacy friendly <sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup> <sup>3</sup> <sup>4</sup> and user friendly rss reader is still under research. Help welcome.

== rss to e-mail ==

Recommend knowledge:

* Introduction on this page
* [E-Mail]

For example [http://rssforward.com/ rssforward] (not affiliated with Whonix and neither recommend nor recommend against) is a rss to e-mail service. As time of writing there are also free rss to e-mail services. Because free services don't have a money trail it's easier to use them anonymously.

If you like to frequently read a website (ex: blog), such as the Whonix News Blog (as recommend on the Download page in the [https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Download/#stay-tuned News] chapter) and don't mind your the rss to e-mail service, mail provider knowing and who knows who else knowing, that you subscribed that blog, you could use such a service to stay on top of latest Whonix News.

For better security you could create a new e-mail address using Tor which you exclusively use only to receive notifications about website updates. Note, that the mail provider could spoof the notification mails.

At the moment the safest way to read blogs is to do it manually in [TorBrowser] or to use a privacy friendly <sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup> <sup>3</sup> <sup>4</sup> rss reader inside Whonix. (See above.)

== rss to sms ==

There are also (free) rss to sms services, perhaps convenient, but they have to be considered even less anonymous than rss to e-mail. (See above.)
